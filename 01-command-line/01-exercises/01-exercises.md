OK Coders Lesson 1 Exercises
====

Complete all homework assignments before coming to the next class or as otherwise instructed.

### 1. Create an express app and upload it to heroku

This evening's homework assignment is straightforward: create a new Express web application just like we did in class and upload it to Heroku. Refer to the [lesson material from today's class](https://github.com/okcoders/bash-heroku-class) if you run into trouble.

This homework assignment is designed to reinforce your understanding of the command line and of git and heroku.

### 2. Review material on the command line and git

Two free books on the command line and on git were mentioned in class. Consider these books textbooks and study them.

- [The Linux Command Line, by William Shots](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) : Read the first four chapters by the end of the week. Practice the material at the command line.
- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) : Read the first two chapters by the end of the week on Getting Started and Git Basics.

### 3. Begin learning JavaScript

We will not start JavaScript programming until the 3rd week, but you should begin learning JavaScript before then. We will use the excellent and free [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for this class. Consider it a textbook.

Read and practice with the first four chapters by the beginning of the third week. Don't put this off! Work in small batches rather than waiting to cram at the end.

If you would like additional JavaScript practice, sign up for a free account at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and begin working through their JavaScript lessons.
